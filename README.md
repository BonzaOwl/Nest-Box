## Nest Box

Nest Box is a personal wordpress theme that powers my personal website, I built this
theme using the tutorial provided by [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/developing-a-wordpress-theme-from-scratch/)
I wanted a simple theme with no sidebar, no added extra's that focused on the content. 

## What's Used

[*] Bootstrap 4
[*] Font Awesome
